Cookiecutter template for my Django 1.7 projects
================================================

Requirements::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Here's how you start a new project::

    $ cookiecutter gh:helderco/django-template

Run that in the folder you want your new project and just answer the questions.

That's it folks!
